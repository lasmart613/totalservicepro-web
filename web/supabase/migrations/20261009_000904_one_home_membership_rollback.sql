-- Undo 20261009_000904. Drops the one-home index, trigger, and functions,
-- and restores user_profiles_sync_membership to the live definition from
-- before this migration (service role sets is_home when the user created
-- the org). Does not change membership rows.
--
-- Run this file BEFORE web/supabase/oneoff/20261009_tony_single_home_rollback.sql.
-- Restoring membership 17 while this trigger is still installed moves home
-- onto 17 and clears membership 13.
-- APPLY ON LIVE SUPABASE after review. This repo does not auto-apply SQL.
